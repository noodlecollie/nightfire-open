* The sniper does not have a crosshair unless scoped.
* When unscoped, the sniper is not 100% accurate.
* When scoped, the accuracy of the sniper is dependent on the speed of mouse movements. Jerkier mouse movements decrease accuracy.
* As in the PC version of Nightfire, the sniper only kills a player who is on full health if they are hit in the head.
* Each sniper has a barely visible laser pointer beam for aiming, along with a small, more visible sprite projected onto the object that the laser hits.
* The military sniper has a green laser and creates a loud noise and a big muzzle flash so that it may cause hidden snipers to reveal themselves. The covert sniper has a blue laser, a quiet sound (because of the silencer) and a small muzzle flash.
