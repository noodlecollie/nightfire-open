* When player weapon boxes are dropped on death, they are only dropped at the feet of the player at the point in the world where they died. They are not flung around the map like the Nightfire ones are (or if they are affected by physics, they only move a little).
* When a weapon box is picked up, the weapons that are added to the player's inventory are shown in the HUD. (The engine may already do this.)
* Weapon spawns can have custom respawn times set by the map maker. A respawn time of -1 takes the default time for the game mode. In addition, the game mode/server configuration can specify a global modifier for weapon respawn times, to increase or decrease them.
* Weapon spawns can also have "tiers" applied, to facilitate weaponsets.
* Weapon damage has falloff based on the distance between the attacker and the victim. This is ignored for certain weapons (eg. sniper, Ronin).
