Standard Ronin from the Nightfire PC games, with the following additions:

* Throwing/deploying a Ronin does not get rid of the remote control. The remote control can be used to detonate the Ronin at any time (but not to control it).
* Alt-fire places the Ronin down where the player's crosshair is pointing, for more precise placement.
* When a Ronin is thrown, it can be detonated and deal enough damage to kill a player on full health if they are relatively close. However, if the Ronin owner dies while the Ronin is thrown but not deployed, the Ronin can be picked up as if it were a weapon spawn. This introduces some risk/reward, as opponents may not know whether a Ronin that looks like a pickup is actually a booby trap.
* If a Ronin is deployed, it can be +used by its owner to pick it back up.
* If the player who owns a deployed Ronin dies, the Ronin disables itself but does not disappear. Enemy players can +use the Ronin to pack it up and take it, or can shoot it to make it explode. The player who died can +use it to gain a new remote control and bring it back to life. Alternatively, the player can walk across another Ronin spawn to gain a remote control to bring their original Ronin back to life. The Ronin spawn is not consumed, and the existing Ronin must be detonated before a new one can be picked up.
* A Ronin that is critically damaged becomes disabled, begins sparking and eventually explodes.
