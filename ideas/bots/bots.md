* Bots can have difficulties and personalities (a la Counter Strike), including weapon preferences and health modifiers.
* Bots can have "memory" of certain tactics on certain maps. For example, every time a player places a Ronin, the position of the Ronin (together with how long it's alive/how many kills it gets) can be recorded in a file. The more players play on a map, the more the bots learn about good Ronin placement.
* Where single player stealth is concerned, bots have a "main" and "peripheral" field of view. If the player becomes visible in their peripheral view, the bot will realise after a certain amount of time (their reaction time) and will try and seek out the player. If the player appears in their main field of view, they will immediately attack the player (or run for an alarm, as appropriate).
