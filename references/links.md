[Crowbar Model Compiler/Decompiler](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/CrowbarTool) by _ZeqMacaw_
[JBN BSP Lump Tools](https://code.google.com/archive/p/jbn-bsp-lump-tools/) - the v2 decompiler is recommended for decompiling Nightfire maps. As much as I disparage Java, the JAR version does run cross-platform. [See here](jbn-decompiler/compatibility.md) for recommended decompilation parameters for individual maps.
