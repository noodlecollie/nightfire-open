For certain models (eg. the Ronin), the default armature pose is not applied to the model in Edit mode. To fix this:

1. Import the model QC.
2. Find the model's mesh in the top right component tree (eg. `w_ronin_reference_ref`).
3. To the right of the mesh name, there should be a blue spanner. Click this to open the modifier settings.
4. For the armature modifier, enable the icon of four vertices in a square (`Display modifier in Edit mode`), and the icon of three vertices in a triangle (`Adjust edit cage to modifier result`).
