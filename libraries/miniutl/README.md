# MiniUTL

This is a fork of GameNetworkingSockets by ValveSoftware, but only their container template library is left.

Unlike Source SDK, this is licensed under BSD, so we can freely use it in Xash3D FWGS and mainui_cpp.

Original issue: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets/issues/36

```Everything in this project uses the same license, so do what you want with it.```
