I. GENERAL TECHNICAL ISSUES

To get the code to run you should have a copy of VS 2005 Final (Pro). The code has not been tested in the betas and the freeware issue of VS 2005 (C++) has no support to compile 64bit.

There are allot of "warnings" when you do compile, but these should be ignored - as fixing them causes compile errors, such as hull holes, and invisible walls - along with bad lighting, and slower complies.

The code should work with a *nix complier that has support for Microsoft secure memory commands.
